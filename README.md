# The-garden-idea
Planning when and where to plant stuff in your garden based on features such as sunlight and compass position, size and shape, soil quality ect.
Need to learn: 1. more about tesxt mineing, it would be nice to create a self updating db of what find of conditioons different plants need, when to plant them and how long each stage takes (future push notification of watering when it is required)
2. Need to learn about graphical user interfaces, the ablity to drag a rectangle into the appropriate shape and then potentially add scale - depending on the complexity of that. Also allow the user to define where they want to plant stuff, be able to section their "garden2/rectangle into growing areas, preferabley free form.
3. How to add in time of year factoring, when to rake ground,. when to soe, when "estiamtely" to halvest - push notifications poss.
4. Following on from time point how to allow once the plant is halvested the user to tell programme and allow new plants to rotae in. And mange which plants are Perennials or Annuals ect.
5. How to get the programme to allocate different plants to different sections, maybe need to have a user filter of how many different plants per section or perhaps make suggestions on what plants could go in each section from a drop down list and suggesting what plants can live together. 
6. How to make the programme user friendly
